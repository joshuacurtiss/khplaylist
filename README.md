An app that helps you build a media playlist to facilitate more convenient and expedient playing of media during the meeting, particularly for sign language congregations that use media extensively during the meeting program.

This is especially intended for congregations with Windows computers, since they cannot use SL Studio and the native JW app does not yet support playlists. But it works on Macs too.

## How does it work? ##

KH Playlist is not intended to compete with or replace the JW "orange" app, and in fact works jointly with it. Use the JW app to download all the required media (songs, publication or Bible chapters, etc) then launch the KH Playlist app and it will utilize the media library within the JW app to play the videos.

Alternatively, you can download videos from [jw.org](https://www.jw.org/ase/publications) and save them in any folder within your user account's video directoryâ€”on Windows it is named "Videos" and on Macs it is named "Movies".

This application isn't signed. That just means your computer will warn you that 
the app is from an "Unknown Publisher". You can bypass the warning and proceed
with installing the app.

## Give me more info on using this thing! ##

First, make sure you've either downloaded some videos from [jw.org](https://www.jw.org/ase/publications) or from the JW app. Then launch the KH Playlist app.

To start using it, click on the playlist line and just start typing naturally. The playlist will recognize scripture and publication references the way they appear in our publications or on [jw.org](https://jw.org), and as best it can, it will try to make sense of what is being entered.

For instance, all of these are valid examples of how to enter scriptures:

* Gen 3:15
* Genesis 3:15
* John 1:1; 17:3
* Matt 24:14, 36-39
* John 17:3; Rev 24:14

Publications can feel a little more tricky but the playlist does a decent job at finding what you're asking for, and it will always work with formal publication reference formatting. For instance: 

* "bhs 5:4" is the formal reference to *"What Can the Bible Teach Us?" ch 5, par 4*.  
* "Teach Us ch5 par 4" will successfully convert to *bhs 5:4*.  
* "Teach Us 5:4" will also successfully convert to *bhs 5:4*. 
* "w17.04 3:1" is the formal reference to *Watchtower #4, article 3, par 1*. 
* "sn 3" is the formal reference to *"Sing to Jehovah" song #3*.  
* "song 3" will also find *sn 3*.  
* "Sing to Jehovah 3" will also find *sn 3*. 

These are just some examples demonstrating the flexibility of the playlist.
