An app that helps you build a media playlist to facilitate more convenient and expedient playing of media during the meeting, particularly for sign language congregations since publication references and scriptures are played during the meeting program.

This is especially intended for congregations with Windows computers, since they cannot use SL Studio and the native JW app does not yet support playlists. 

## How does it work? ##

KH Playlist is not intended to compete with or replace the JW "orange" app, and in fact works jointly with it. Use the JW app to download all the required media (songs, publication or Bible chapters, etc), then launch the KH Playlist app and it will utilize the media library within the JW app to play the videos. The video cues embedded in the video files are used to find a given verse or paragraph in the video.

Alternatively, you can download videos from [jw.org](https://www.jw.org/ase/publications) and save them in any folder within your user account's video directory; on Windows it will be named "Videos" and on Macs it will be named "Movies".

## How do I start adding videos to the playlist? ##

Click on the playlist line and just start typing naturally. The playlist will recognize scripture and publication references the way they appear in our publications or on [jw.org](https://jw.org), and as best it can, it will try to make sense of what is being entered.

For instance, all of these are valid examples of how to enter scriptures:

```
Gen 3:15
Genesis 3:15
John 1:1; 17:3
Matt 24:14, 36-39
John 17:3; Rev 24:14
```

Publications can feel a little more tricky but the playlist does a decent job at finding what you're asking for, and it will always work with formal publication reference formatting. For instance: 

`bhs 5:4` is the formal reference to "What Can the Bible Teach Us?" chapter 5, paragraph 4.  
`Teach Us ch5 par 4` will successfully convert to `bhs 5:4`.  
`Teach Us 5:4` will successfully convert to `bhs 5:4`. 

`w17.04 3:1` is the formal reference to Watchtower #4, article 3, paragraph 1. 

`sn 3` is the formal reference to "Sing to Jehovah" song #3.  
`song 3` will also find `sn 3`.  
`Sing to Jehovah 3` will also find `sn 3`. 

These are just some examples demonstrating the flexibility of the playlist.
